> Manages lines of people on attractions in the Universal Park

The Universal Park has a system of lines that consists of three different groups: the **Express**, which is made of guests who paid an extra money and have **priority** in almost every attraction; the **Regular**, which consists of people who didn't buy the Express pass; and the **Single Rider** line, which allows people to, usually, go faster in an attraction with the downside of being split of their parties, they are basically **used to fill empty spaces**. These lines are commanded by one person that keeps telling people in which row of the attraction they sould go. **This script**, following some business rules, **finds a way to automate this proccess**

## ‚òï Using the Universal Line Manager

To change the lines you only have to change the file `Lines.txt`, located in the `Attractions` folder. You can also create more attractions by adding more lines to the `attractions.txt` following the `pattern.txt` file, both also located in the `Attractions` folder. Then, you can run the `main.py` in the cmd py typing `python main.py` in the root folder.
